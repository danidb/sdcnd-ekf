# SDCND Extended Kalman Filter

This project is part of the Udacity self-driving car engineer nanodegree.  
Some template code was  provided  by Udacity, it has  been but the overall architecture remains (mostly) the same, for the sake of easier evaluation. 


## Results
The Extended Kalman Filter is applied to the sample data provided by Udacity. The result can be visualized below (see `viz.R`).
